## Associating bundled classes

Modifications made to a query ("checkbundles") with resulting variables and conditional statements
that provide structure and styling to a link that denotes an association to a particular grouping
or courses. These resulting conditionals also control the ability for a student to register for
the course singly, or bundled with other courses. This link then triggers a modal window created
with the JQuery BlockUI plugin that was favored to sustain the legacy-based UI of the application,
for consistency.

The modal window opens iframe-contained content with a dropdown-type, expandable element
that when expanded, results in the modal window being scrollable along the y-axis.

*Visual references of the UI are provided as JPG files that show the accessible link that
associates the course to the bundled group of courses, and the resulting modal window that
displays once the link is clicked. Additionally, a snapshot of the resulting HTML shows
the structure of the iframe content nested within the modal window.*
